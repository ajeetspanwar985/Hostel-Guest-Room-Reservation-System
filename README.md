# üè† Hostel Guest Room Reservation System (Python Project)

A modular Python-based project that automates hostel guest room bookings for parents and guardians visiting students.  
Currently implemented as a **console-based system**, this project will later include a **GUI interface** and additional advanced modules.

## üìå Project Overview

Many hostels still maintain guest room records manually using paper registers, leading to confusion, double bookings, and time delays.  
This project aims to digitalize the entire process using **Python** and **file handling**, creating a simple yet efficient system to manage room reservations.

It allows hostel staff to:
- Add, update, or cancel guest bookings  
- Allocate available rooms automatically  
- Track check-ins and check-outs  
- Maintain a digital record of all visitors  

All records are stored in a lightweight **text file (`bookings.txt`)** that functions as the system‚Äôs database.
