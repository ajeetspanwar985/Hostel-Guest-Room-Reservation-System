# üè† Hostel Guest Room Reservation System (Python Project)

A modular Python-based project that automates hostel guest room bookings for parents and guardians visiting students.  
Currently implemented as a **console-based system**, this project will later include a **GUI interface** and additional advanced modules.

## üìå Project Overview

Many hostels still maintain guest room records manually using paper registers, leading to confusion, double bookings, and time delays.  
This project aims to digitalize the entire process using **Python** and **file handling**, creating a simple yet efficient system to manage room reservations.

It allows hostel staff to:
- Add, update, or cancel guest bookings  
- Allocate available rooms automatically  
- Track check-ins and check-outs  
- Maintain a digital record of all visitors  

All records are stored in a lightweight **text file (`bookings.txt`)** that functions as the system‚Äôs database.

## üß© Modules Implemented (Current Phase)

| Module No. | Module Name | Description |
|-------------|--------------|--------------|
| **1** | File Handling & Database | Stores and retrieves booking records from a text file |
| **2** | Reservation Management | Add, update, cancel, and search guest bookings |
| **3** | Room Allocation | Automatically assigns available rooms (101‚Äì120) |
| **4** | Check-In / Check-Out System | Marks guests as arrived or departed |
| **5** | User Interface & Integration | Simple menu-based console interface connecting all modules |

## üß© Modules Planned (Next Phase)

| Module No. | Module Name | Description |
|-------------|--------------|--------------|
| **6** | Policy Enforcement | Apply hostel rules like stay limits and relation checks |
| **7** | Sorting & Reporting | Generate daily/monthly visitor and room usage reports |
| **8** | Notifications & Receipts | Add digital receipts or QR confirmations |
| **9** | Testing & Documentation | Detailed testing scripts and user documentation |
| **GUI (Tkinter)** | User Interface Upgrade | Replace console with GUI for real-world usability |

## ‚öôÔ∏è Technologies Used

- **Language:** Python  
- **Concepts:** File Handling, Conditional Statements, Loops, Functions  
- **Data Storage:** Text file (`bookings.txt`)  
- **Planned Extensions:** GUI (Tkinter), Database (MySQL or SQLite)

## üöÄ How to Run the Project

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/Hostel-Guest-Room-Reservation-System.git

2. Move into the project folder:
cd Hostel-Guest-Room-Reservation-System


3. Run the program:
python system.py


Follow the menu options to:

Add / Update / Cancel Reservations

Check-In or Check-Out Guests

Search Records or View All Bookings

üß† Learning Outcomes

Understanding Python file handling and data management

Building modular programs for scalability

Learning how to simulate a database using text files

Foundation for integrating GUI and DBMS

Problem-solving and logical structuring for real-world use cases

üå± Future Scope

This system will later be upgraded with:

A Tkinter GUI interface for user-friendly booking management

Database connectivity using SQLite or MySQL

Automated reports for visitor tracking and analytics

Email/SMS notifications for booking confirmations

QR code receipts for contactless guest entry

These improvements will make the project suitable for real hostel environments and digital campus initiatives.
